Yo, so we're gonna build this from scratch. I don't care if you think it's impossible Definitely do some research into how we can do it. Well. Yeah, we essentially want to be able to convert any video I mean we can assume they're gonna be dot mp4s probably into Some sort of format that can be perfectly played in any terminal like we're gonna start with the bash terminal and Ubuntu just to get It working on that, but essentially we want this like rendering engine type of thing And I'm sure this is possible we just have to figure out how to do it I don't know what we're gonna write it in a preferably rust if possible, but let's look into this and then Yeah, we're gonna have to solve this though so kind of this project is gonna have two main folders that you can just make right away and we just keep everything really clean and then inside of those so we'll have the Actual terminal tool and then we'll have the I Don't know what we'll call it something like the converter right the converter folder that you can input mp4 and get out the New type of video file that then is like able to be displayed in the terminal And played and whatnot you know, obviously we want to be pretty high detail high quality and then It also needs to be super super fast because like preferably we want this later on for like Some sort of AI interface or something. I think that'd be kind of cool Or just for like future projects. It's this would just be amazing because then you're like CLI interfaces could be like This really interesting thing and it can have input and all that. So let's just first look into this, you know it's 2026 so we can do some research and then Yeah, we'll start formulating a plan on how to do this as simply as possible, but all fully working
